# Sentimental Analysis on Airline Tweets

### Summary
- Web Application to classify the tweets on US Airlines into Negative, Positive or Neutral classes.
- Used NLP techniques (tokenization, n-grams, stemming, stopwords removal) and other Machine Learning (Bayesian networks, Neural networks, SVM, Lexical bag of words) algorithms in R and Python
- Comparison of the prediction accuracy of different supervised classifiers used.

### Built with
1. Python
2. R

### Steps
1. **Python** </br>
Install the following modules
   - **tweepy** - a Python wrapper for the Twitter API. [Documentation](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/tree/master/docs), [Streaming_how_to](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy/blob/master/docs/streaming_how_to.rst)
   - **textblob** - library for processing textual data. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more.
   
2. **R** </br>
Packages:
   - **tm package**: A framework for text mining applications within R. It does a good job for text cleaning (stemming, delete the stopwords, etc) and transforming texts to document-term matrix (dtm). 
   - **wordcloud**
